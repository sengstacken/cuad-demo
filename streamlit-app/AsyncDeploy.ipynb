If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall: (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money specified in this Agreement to be made; or (ii) fail to observe or perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations under this Agreement (other than the payment of money), the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: As to a default under clause (i) above, if such payment is not made within 10 business days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment; or, as to a default under clause (ii) above, if such other default is not cured within 30 days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default. In order to be a sufficient notice under this section, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default and shall specify the provision of this Agreement which applies to each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party is required to take in order to cure each item of default. The termination rights set forth in this section shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the non-defaulting party under this Agreement, however, and if default is made by either party under this Agreement, the other party may resort to such other remedies as such party would have been entitled to if this section had been omitted from this Agreement, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Termination under the provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims which the terminating party may otherwise have against the defaulting party, and if Company is the defaulting party, Company shall be responsible for any and all payments due under the terms of this Agreement in addition to other liabilities set forth above.

Except as provided in paragraph B of this SECTION TEN, from and after the termination of the Contract Period, all of the rights of Company to the use of the name of the NFLA shall cease absolutely and Company subsequently shall not use or refer to the NFLA in advertising or promotion in any manner whatsoever. Except as provided in paragraph B below, it is further agreed that following termination of the Contract Period, Company shall not advertise, promote, distribute or sell any item whatsoever in connection with the use of any name, figure, design, logo, trademark or trade name similar to or suggestive of the NFLA.    1. Company may liquidate and sell its inventory of Licensed Products (including any inventory then in production) for a period of ninety (90) days after the termination date of the Contract Period, subject to the Company\\'s continued obligation to pay the Fee as provided above, and will deliver the Sales Report with respect to such liquidation sales within 30 days following the end of the first reached full quarter following termination.      2. If Company has not disposed of all Licensed Products as provided in subparagraph 1 above by the end of the 90 day period, Company, at its option, may either: (a) remove or obliterate entirely from such Licensed Products (and any labels, tags, riders and the like) all references to any NFLA Identification, and then sell the same; or (b) destroy all such remaining Licensed Products.   7\\n\\nSource: GRIDIRON BIONUTRIENTS, INC., 8-K, 12/6/2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      SECTION ELEVEN.

SECTION TWELVE. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS   All rights not specifically granted in this Agreement to Company shall remain the property of the NFLA to be used in any manner the NFLA deems appropriate. Company understands that the NFLA has reserved the right to authorize others to use the name of the NFLA within the Contract Territory and during the Contract Period in connection with all tangible and intangible items and services other than Products themselves. NFLA is not aware of any such rights that would conflict with the nature or image of Company Products.   SECTION THIRTEEN. INDEMNITY   Company agrees to protect, indemnify and hold harmless the NFLA / NFLA-NC and their authorized agents, or any of them, from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, including reasonable attorney\\'s fees, arising out of, or in any way connected with, actions or omissions of Company, any advertising material furnished by, or an behalf of, Company, or any claim or action for personal injury, death or other cause of action involving alleged defects in Company\\'s Products or services. Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general commercial and product liability insurance.   SECTION FOURTEEN. SPECIAL RIGHT OF TERMINATION   Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, upon written notice to the NFLA / NFLA-NC, if the commercial value of the NFLA\\'s endorsement is substantially reduced because an officer of the NFLA / NFLA-NC: (i) has been charged with illegal or immoral conduct which could result in a felony conviction and such charges have not been dismissed or terminated within 90 days. Any termination pursuant to this section shall become effective on the business day next following the date of receipt by NFLA of Company\\'s written notice to so terminate.   SECTION FIFTEEN.

In no event will NFLA be liable for any indirect, incidental, reliance, special or consequential damages arising out of the performance or nonperformance of this Agreement, whether or not NFLA had been advised of the possibility of such damages.   SECTION SEVENTEEN. WAIVER   The failure of either party at any time or times to demand strict performance by the other party of any of the terms, covenants or conditions set forth in this Agreement shall not be construed as a continuing waiver or relinquishment of the same and each party may at any time demand strict and complete performance by the other party of such terms, covenants and conditions. Any waiver of such rights must be set forth in writing.   SECTION EIGHTEEN. SEVERABILITY   If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable by any judicial or administrative authority, the validity of any other provision and of the entire Agreement shall not be affected by such declaration.   SECTION NINETEEN. ASSIGNMENT   This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of Company and NFLA and their respective successors and assigns.   SECTION TWENTY.

All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located within 225 miles of Hayward, California. Each party is entitled to depose one fact witness and all expert witnesses retained by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.   SECTION TWENTY-ONE.
